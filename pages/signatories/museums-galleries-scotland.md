[Museums Galleries Scotland](http://www.museumsgalleriesscotland.org.uk/) (MGS) is the National Development Body for the museum sector in Scotland. Our role is to work collaboratively to invest in and develop a sustainable museum and galleries sector for Scotland. Digital development is a a key feature across the areas of advocacy, skills development and enterprise which underpin our [strategic delivery plan](http://www.museumsgalleriesscotland.org.uk/national-strategy-and-delivery/national-strategy-delivery/realising-the-vision:-delivering-public-value) for Scottish museums. 

We offer advice and training on digital development to the Scottish museum sector through our own courses or through specific projects such as the [Wikimedian in Residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/Museums_Galleries_Scotland) project which is teaching curators and museum staff how to edit Wikipedia.

MGS are also exploring ways in which they can encourage and support it's employees to be more confident and skilled users of digital technology.
